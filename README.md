# PhotoCullingAssistant

An app to assist with quickly and easily culling photos after a shoot, from your tablet or laptop.

The goal of this app is to very easily navigate through and cull photos, resulting in files which can then be added to
the folder with the RAWs in order to automatically be imported to your photo editor of choice.

## TODO:

### Core

- save rating / pick status to EXIF as a sidecar file XMP format
- subfolders per shoot, maintain DCIM folder structure

### Important

- culling progress indicator (to be improved)
- pinch to zoom (probably not, too many gestures!)
- Desktop functionality (lower priority)

### Nice to have

- double tap to mark picked
- pinch to zoom, pinch out or swipe down to navigate up
- smooth, slow animations
- filter shoot by rating
- quick overview, a fast way to see more details about culling progress (photos grouped by stars in shoot view?)
- DONE animation when finishing rating a shoot
- (maybe) auto-advance after voting (option)
