# PhotoCullingAssistant

An app to assist with quickly and easily culling photos after a shoot, from your tablet or laptop.

The goal of this app is to very easily navigate through and cull

## TODO:

### Core

- save rating / pick status to EXIF as a sidecar file XMP format
- auto import photos by folder name (use OS media picker)
- 5+2 star rating : PICK x x x x x REJECT
- full brightness while voting, screen always on

### Important

- subfolders per shoot, maintain DCIM folder structure
- culling progress indicator
- pinch to zoom
- Desktop functionality (lower priority)

### Nice to have

- double tap to mark picked
- pinch to zoom, pinch out or swipe down to navigate up
- smooth, slow animations
- filter shoot by rating
- quick overview, a fast way to see more details about culling progress (photos grouped by stars in shoot view?)
- DONE animation when finishing rating a shoot
- (maybe) auto-advance after voting (option)
- (maybe) long press to hide UI / also when pinch to zoom
